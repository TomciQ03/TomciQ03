# 👋 Hi, I'm Tomek Marek

I'm a **Mechatronics student** at **Wrocław University of Science and Technology**,  
currently working on my **engineering thesis project** — an *autonomous car platform* with **lane and traffic sign detection**.  
I enjoy building things that connect **software, electronics, and mechanics** into real, working systems.

## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 I’m developing my skills in **Python** and **C++**, focusing on writing clean, understandable, and efficient code.  
- 🧠 I love learning new technologies — from **computer vision** and **control systems** to **embedded devices**.  
- 🔧 I understand how embedded systems work and I’m eager to keep exploring this area in future projects.  
- ⚙️ I’m not afraid of challenges — I learn quickly and treat every project as a chance to grow.  
- 🎯 My main goal is to become a **software developer** with strong technical and practical engineering background.

## 🧩 Current Project — Engineering Thesis

## [🚗 Autonomous Car Platform](https://github.com/TomciQ03/Autonomus_car)


A Python-based computer vision project that detects **road lanes** and **traffic signs** using **OpenCV** and **NumPy**,  
built completely **without machine learning** — only classical mathematical image analysis.

**Status:** In development  
**Goal:** To integrate lane and sign detection into one system running on a **Raspberry Pi** autonomous vehicle.

## 🌱 What Drives Me

I like experimenting with different technologies and combining ideas from various engineering fields.  
For me, programming is not just about code — it’s about **making things work**.  
I value curiosity, continuous learning, and building projects that actually *do something*.
